# holbertonschool-low_level_programming

## üìò Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the low-level programming projects assigned during the first year at Holberton School. The projects are primarily written in the C programming language and are designed to build a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, memory management, and system-level programming.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific project or concept:

- [hello_world](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/hello_world)
- [variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/variables_if_else_while)
- [functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/functions_nested_loops)
- [more_functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/more_functions_nested_loops)
- [pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/pointers_arrays_strings)
- [recursion](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/recursion)
- [malloc_free](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/malloc_free)
- [more_malloc_free](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/more_malloc_free)
- [structures_typedef](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/structures_typedef)
- [function_pointers](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/function_pointers)
- [variadic_functions](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/variadic_functions)
- [singly_linked_lists](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/singly_linked_lists)
- [doubly_linked_lists](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/doubly_linked_lists)
- [file_io](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/file_io)
- [argc_argv](https://github.com/JorreJ/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/argc_argv)

Each directory contains source code files, header files, and a `README.md` that provides details about the specific project.

## üß† Learning Objectives

Throughout these projects, I have learned and applied the following concepts:

- Writing and compiling C programs using `gcc`.
- Understanding and implementing control structures (`if`, `else`, `while`, `for`).
- Working with functions, loops, and recursion.
- Manipulating pointers, arrays, and strings.
- Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using `malloc` and `free`.
- Defining and using structures and typedefs.
- Utilizing function pointers and variadic functions.
- Implementing and traversing singly and doubly linked lists.
- Performing file input/output operations.
- Handling command-line arguments (`argc` and `argv`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation and Coding Style

- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `gcc` with the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`.
- Code adheres to the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) coding style.
